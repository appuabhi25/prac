Git is the most commonly used version control system today. A Git workflow is a recipe or
recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner.
Git workflows encourage developers and DevOps teams to leverage Git effectively and
consistently.
When working with a team on a Git-managed project, itâ€™s important to make sure the team is all
in agreement on how the flow of changes will be applied. To ensure the team is on the same
page, an agreed-upon Git workflow should be developed or selected.
